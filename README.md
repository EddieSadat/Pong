# Pong
This was one of my first Python projects after starting learning it.
A mentor was guiding me step-by-step and teaching me how to implement the basics into a unified project.
It was here when I learned that I had to search for help online and not rely on people all the time- thanks StackOverflow!

main.py is the initial incompleted project,
main2.py is the project with collision handling added
